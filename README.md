# I gotta commit!

> Because why not

## Installation
```
yarn global add i-gotta-commit
```
 
 or
 
```
npm install -g i-gotta-commit
```
 
 
## Usage

Simply type in `lyric` to get a few random lines from popular songs.

```
lyric
```

A cool way to use this is like to create an alias for the following:

```
lyric | git commit -F -
```

## Add more lyrics

I'll keep adding lyrics when I can. PRs are more than welcome!
