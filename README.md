# I Gotta Commit

> Because why not

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g i-gotta-commit
```

## Usage

Simply type in `lyrics` to get a few random lines from popular songs.

```sh
lyrics
```

A cool way to use this is like to create an alias for the following:

```sh
lyrics | git commit -F -
```

## Add more lyrics

I'll keep adding lyrics when I can. PRs are more than welcome!
