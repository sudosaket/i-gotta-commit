Don't criticize what you can't understand
Oh I'll tremble for your love always
It could be wrong, could be wrong, \nbut it should have been right
Blackbird singing in the dead of night \nTake these broken wings and learn to fly
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld \nSo I can sigh eternally
Libraries gave us power \nThen work came and made us free \nWhat price now for a shallow piece of dignity?
But we're trash you and me \n We're the litter on the breeze \n We're the lovers on the streets
Bones sinking like stones \n All that we've fought for \n Homes, places we've grown \n All of us are done for
You came on your own, that's how you'll leave \n With hope in your hands and air to breathe
This is the straw, final straw in the \n Roof of my mouth as I lie to you \n Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean \n I didn't enjoy it at the time
