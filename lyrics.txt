Don't criticize what you can't understand
It could be wrong, could be wrong, \nbut it should have been right
Blackbird singing in the dead of night \nTake these broken wings and learn to fly
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld \nSo I can sigh eternally
Libraries gave us power \nThen work came and made us free \nWhat price now for a shallow piece of dignity?
Bones sinking like stones \n All that we've fought for \n Homes, places we've grown \n All of us are done for
You came on your own, that's how you'll leave \n With hope in your hands and air to breathe
This is the straw, final straw in the \n Roof of my mouth as I lie to you \n Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean \n I didn't enjoy it at the time
Well, I’ve been afraid of changing \n‘Cause I’ve built my life around you \nBut time makes you bolder \nEven children get older \nAnd I’m getting older too
If I fail, if I succeed \nAt least I’ll live as I believe \nNo matter what they take from me
Some of it’s magic \nSome of it’s tragic \nBut I had a good life all the way
You may say I'm a dreamer \nBut I'm not the only one
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run \nThere’s still time to change the road you’re on \nAnd it makes me wonder
I try to stay awake and remember my name, but \neverybody’s changing and I don’t feel the same
There is another world \nthere is a better world \nthere must be
She said the hardest thing in the world to do \nis to find somebody who believes in you
Looking for evil, thinking they can trace it, but \nevil don’t look like anything
Half of the time we’re gone and we don’t know where
They will never forget you till somebody new comes along
And now that it’s over \nI promise you I’ll go \nWandering tonight \nAnd never come home
The trouble with talking is it makes you sound clever \nand the trouble with waiting is you just wait forever
And if you think you see with just your eyes, you’re mad
I made a lot of mistakes. \nAll things go, all things go
Sometimes I feel like it’s all been done \nSometimes I feel like I’m the only one \nSometimes I want to change everything I’ve ever done \nI’m too tired to fight and yet too scared to run
We’re all gonna die
